The ridgeline plot displays the distribution of Airbnb review scores across Edinburgh neighborhoods. Neighborhoods are ordered by their median review scores, allowing us to easily compare their central tendencies and spread. Higher ridges indicate more frequent score values. We observe that some areas consistently have higher review scores, while others show greater variability. Listings with missing neighborhood or review data were excluded here.
